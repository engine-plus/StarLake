  * Default [[LogStore]] implementation (should be used for testing only!).

  * Production users should specify the appropriate [[[LogStore]] implementation in Spark properties.
  *
  * We assume the following from [[org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem]] implementations:
  * - Rename without overwrite is atomic.
  * - List-after-write is consistent.
  *
  * Regarding file creation, this implementation:
  * - Uses atomic rename when overwrite is false; if the destination file exists or the rename
  * fails, throws an exception.
  * - Uses create-with-overwrite when overwrite is true. This does not make the file atomically
  * visible and therefore the caller must handle partial files.
